- hw1 -> Reading numbers at the input and performing elementary mathematical operations
- hw2 -> We read numbers at the input, perform elementary mathematical operations in a loop
- hw3 -> We read the height, width at the entrance and build, draw a house in the terminal
- hw4 -> We read the numbers at the input and split the number into prime divisors.
- hw5 -> We read two texts at the input and use the Caesar cipher to determine the encoded message
- hw6 -> We read the numbers and the operator at the input. We build matrices from the obtained numbers and perform mathematical operations
- hw7 -> We enter the text we want to find and enter the file in which we are looking for this text
- hw8 -> Working with a circular queue
- hw9 -> Working with an ordinary graph. Read data from file and save to file
- hw10 -> Working with a graph using Dijkstra's Algorithm
